# Calculator-App

A Calculator App for Android. This project currently exists to help me get familiar with Android Studio. 
My task is to be able to fully mirror the functionality and UI of the default calculator app on my Samsung phone.


Currently, the UI is setup to look exactly like the target app, but is missing its animations and a textbox to display
quick solutions to the expression being typed. For now, however, the main concern is animations such as a some sort of indication that a 
button has been clicked and that the input screen has been cleared


The functionality is essentially complete now. The calculator can now make use of all of its buttons to make calculations. Inputting 
functions and the backspace keys still need some work, but for now those are minor concerns. An error will popup if the format is 
incorrect regardless.
