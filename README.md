# Calculator-App

A Calculator App for Android. This project currently exists to help me get familiar with Android Studio. 
My task is to be able to fully mirror the functionality and UI of the default calculator app on my Samsung S7 Edge.


Currently, the UI is setup to look exactly like the target app, but is missing its animations and a textbox to display
quick solutions to the expression being typed. 

The functionality is intermediate at the moment, only supporting addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, parenthesis, decimals, and percentages. Functions and exponentials are next with their ui
in the lanscape view almost complete!
